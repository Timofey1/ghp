I've been programming in Python for about seven years, started with web frameworks, developing the backend. In 2018, my friends and I started making websites on freelance. Then I got interested in machine learning and data analysis, started taking courses and solving cases on Kaggle, learning different tasks: classification or regression, NLP, time series analysis and computer vision.

Now I work in the computer vision department. During my time I have managed to work on various projects: style transfer, video enhancement, face recognition, tracking, segmentation, detection, classification. I have worked with such architectures as CNNs, GANs, Transformers, Siamese nets, YOLO, Detectron2, etc.
