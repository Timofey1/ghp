I have been programming in Python for about seven years, I started with web frameworks, developed the backend. In 2018, my friends and I started making freelance websites. Then I got interested in machine learning and data analysis, started taking courses and solving cases on Kaggle, studied various tasks: classification or regression, NLP, time series analysis and computer vision.

I currently work in the computer vision department.
During this work, i managed to work on various projects: style transfer, video quality improvement, face recognition, tracking, segmentation, detection, classification. And worked with such architectures as CNNs, GANs, Transformers, Siamese nets, YOLO, Detectron2.
