Pros/Cons: Java is a very fast language in comparison to its competitors, which helps to build more maintainable and scalable software. It also is easily portable due to it’s “Write once, Run anywhere” function. Java also has a true garbage collection which creates a huge advantage over other languages. 

Java is a more disciplined language, so it is not as flexible and friendly as some other languages. In comparison, Python syntax is very concise and easily readable. Java devs are a little more rare, meaning the networking opportunities and support are less easy to come by. 

## 4. R
<hr>
R is quickly rising the ranks as one of the most popular programming languages for data science, and for good reason. R is a highly extensible and easy to learn language that fosters an environment for statistical computing and graphics.

All of this makes R an ideal choice for data science, big data, and machine learning. 

R is a powerful scripting language. This being so, means that R can handle large and complex data sets. This combined with it’s ever growing community makes it a top tier option for an aspiring data scientist. 

Best used for: R is best used in the world of data science. It is especially powerful when performing statistical operations. 

Pros/Cons: R has numerous pros including being open-source, large amount of support, multiple packages, quality plotting and graphing as well as various machine learning operations.

The biggest downside of using R is security. R lacks basic security and as such it can not be embedded into a web application. 

## 5. C/C++
<hr>
C is a great programming language to learn data science because it is one of the earliest programming languages, and because of this most newer languages use C/C++ as their codebase. 

C/C++ are surprisingly useful for data science, due to their ability to compile data quickly. This allows programmers to have a much broader command of their applications. The low-level nature of C/C++ allows developers to dig deeper and fine tune certain aspects of applications that otherwise wouldn't be possible. 

Best used for: C/C++ is best used for projects with massive scalability and performance requirements. 

Pros/Cons: C/C++ is extremely fast and is actually the only language that can compile over a gigabyte of data in less than a second. This is especially useful for big data applications. 

While C/C++ is incredibly useful for data science, it is among the more complicated side of programming languages for beginners due to its low-level nature. 

## 6. SQL
<hr>
SQL is a very important language to learn in order to be a great data scientist. It is so important because a data scientist needs SQL in order to handle structured data. SQL gives you access to data and statistics which makes it a very useful resource for data science. 

A database is necessary for data science, thus making using a database language such as SQL a necessity.  Anyone dealing with big data will need to have a sound knowledge of SQL in order to query databases. 

Best used for: SQl is the standard and most widely used programming languages for relational databases. 

Pros/Cons: SQL is a non-procedural language, this means that it does not require the use of traditional programming logic. This makes using SQL much easier because you don't have to be an expert coder. 

SQL has a difficult interface that can make users uncomfortable when using the database. Some versions of SQL can be very costly and due to hidden business rules, complete control of the database is not always given. 

## 7. MATLAB
<hr>
MATLAB is a very powerful tool for mathematical and statistical computing, that allows implementation of algorithms and user interface creation. UI creation is especially easy with MATLAB due to it’s built in graphics for creating data plots and visualization. 

This language is especially useful for learning data science, it is mostly used as a resource to accelerate knowledge of data science. Learning MATLAB is a great way to easily transition into deep learning, due to its functionality of the deep learning toolbox.
